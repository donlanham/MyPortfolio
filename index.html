  <h2>Hey, I'm Don!</h2>
              </header>
	<p class = wrapper>I'm a Software Engineer from Chicago, Illinois</p>
  <br>
  <p class = wrapper>I'm a father of two with a beautiful wife, they are my world. I've been an autodidact for nearly 20 years, but have recently taken to a more structured environment to advance myself in this field. It's not easy to balance working full time, spending time with my family, and learning, but I'm honestly enjoying it. Being able to learn more about something I'm actually interested in is a beautiful thing, and continuing to do so will enable my family and I to have the ideal future.</p>

  <h2>About Me</h2>
          </header>
 <p class = wrapper>I've got quite a variety of past experiences that make me unique in this new journey I'm on:</p>
  <br>
  <ul>
    <li>I ran my own Process Serving company for 8 years</li>
    <li>I was a mildly successful Twitch Streamer for 2 years</li>
    <li>I was a Logistics Coordinator for 3 years</li>
  </ul>
   <br>       
	<p class = wrapper>I'm an avid gamer, I spend most of my alone playing video games. My wife and I often go on "Pokemon Go Dates" where we will go to a busier area and hang out for a few hours playing Pokemon Go. We've recently taken to playing Animal Crossing: New Horizons as a family, with each of us playing a copy of the game on our own Nintendo Switch console together.</p>
	<p class = wrapper>I was raised to always be the absolute best at anything I do. I've accomplished this goal multiple times in my life already, and I'm very excited to have the opportunity to work towards this again in a field that I've always had a passion for.</p>

  <footer class = wrapper>
    <p>I love problem solving and working as part of a team. Working as part of a team is, in my opinion, the best way to grow very fast. It allows you to solve a problem in your head and then see how other people would solve the same problem, often in a different way. This kind of learning opportunity is invaluable.</p>
