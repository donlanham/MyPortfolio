  <h2>Hey, I'm Don!</h2>
              </header>
	<p class = wrapper>I'm a Software Engineer from Chicago, Illinois</p>
  <br>
  <p class = wrapper>I'm a father of two with a beautiful wife, they are my world. I've been an autodidact for nearly 20 years, but have recently taken to a more structured environment to advance myself in this field. It's not easy to balance working full time, spending time with my family, and learning, but I'm honestly enjoying it. Being able to learn more about something I'm actually interested in is a beautiful thing, and continuing to do so will enable my family and I to have the ideal future.</p>

  <h2>About Me</h2>
          </header>
 <p class = wrapper>I've got quite a variety of past experiences that make me unique in this new journey I'm on:</p>
  <br>
  <ul>
    <li>I ran my own Process Serving company for 8 years</li>
    <li>I was a mildly successful Twitch Streamer for 2 years</li>
    <li>I was a Logistics Coordinator for 3 years</li>
  </ul>
   <br>       
	<p class = wrapper> I sort of fell into the legal field by accident, and ended up really enjoying it. I saw where there was an opportunity to make a lot of money and took it, starting my own independent process server business. This was during the housing crisis in the late 00's and early 10's, and I worked primarily with 'Foreclosure Mill' firms - serving people with notices that the foreclosure paperwork was going to be filed all the way up until the property had been sold at auction and the new owner was evicting the previous.</p>
  <p class = wrapper> While doing this, I was spending a lot of my free time playing video games. When the game Overwatch launched their Closed Beta I was invited and quickly became very skilled at the game. My friends and I began streaming on Twitch and I eventually was part of what became known as the "Wave One Overwatch Pros", playing with some of the players who went on to become full-time professional gamers in The Overwatch League. I was faced with a decision on if I was going to risk going pro or if I was going to continue running my business, and I opted for the latter. Now, I don't stream at all or play games all that often, but I'm still a Twitch viewer/moderator.</p>
  <p class = wrapper> After all of this happened, I was more focused than ever on making sure that my family would be provided for. In January of 2018 several laws regarding Service of Process changed, which put a complete and total halt on all Foreclosures in the State of Illinois for several months. During this time, I began looking for a side-job and was hired as a Reverse Logistics Specialist, which offered me enough to close the door on my sole proprietorship and pivot into a new field. I worked my way up through Reverse Logistics until I was offered an Operations Coordinator position, and moved to the Operations side.</p>

  <footer class = wrapper>
    <p> I was raised to always be the absolute best at anything I do. I've accomplished this goal multiple times in my life already, and I'm very excited to have the opportunity to work towards this again in a field that I've always had a passion for. </p>
